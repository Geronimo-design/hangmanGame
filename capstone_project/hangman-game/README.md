                  The rules of the game are as follows:



          In order to progress, you must click on a specific key containing a
          letter that you think will be somewhere in the word that will prevent
          the man from being hanged.



          You need to ensure that the complete word is created to prevent the
          man from being hanged.



          Should you click on a letter on the keyboard that is not present in
          the word that will save the man, he will be one step closer to being
          hanged.



          Should you exhaust enough attempts at guessing the correct letters in
          the word, the man will be hanged and you lose the game. Should you
          guess enough letters in the word to be correct, such that the word is
          completed, the man will be saved and you win the game.
